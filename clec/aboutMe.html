       <center><img src="IMG_0308.jpg" height="400"></center> 
        <p>Since a young age I've grown up messing with computers and gadgets, leading me to work with VOIP phones from the age of 12. 
            Since then I had worked with my step-father Kurt Kaiser. 
            During my childhood he would bring me on jobs and task me with learning how VOIP systems work and how they are programmed.</p>
        <p>Once I graduated highschool I worked at one of our partners, Netexpress providing support and programming to new and existing customers. 
            This gave me the exsperience with working on a PBX system as well as working with clients and mapping out how they would like their phone system.</p>
        <p>Sadly, in 2022 Kurt was diagnosed with cancer, so I started to work for him full time, picking up the work he was unable to do. 
                When Kurt passed away in 2023, I was left with the company and continuing to run it today.</p>
